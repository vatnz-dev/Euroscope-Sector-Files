## About this Repo

This repository is home to the VATSIM Sector Files for VATNZ. This is hosted on GitHub so that ongoing development and releases can be effectively managed, as well as enabling other VATNZ members to contribute updates to *their* Sector Files.

A new sector file will be released in line with each AIRAC cycle, as long as significant changes are released. 



## Release History

AIRAC 2006  - issued **21 May 2020**. 

Please note that no AIRACS have been released using this repository yet. This page will be updated when a new release is announced.



## Branches

```master``` - This is the current mainstream release of the NZZC sector files.

```rnav-paths``` - This is a project that will introduce all of the RNAV approach paths for New Zealand (with some exceptions).

```ground``` - This is a project to overhaul the ground RADAR views (yet to be started).
